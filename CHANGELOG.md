## 3.1.0 - 2020-07-17

### Added

- Tests with Molecule and either Vagrant+VirtualBox or Docker
- (GH-30) Added support for EL8
- Added support for Fedora 31. Fedora 32 is as of yet not supported by MariaDB.
- (GH-34) Added unix_socket authentication capability and skip password tasks for 10.4 because it has secure passwordless login with unix_socket by default. (credit: [@herd-the-cats](https://github.com/herd-the-cats))
- (GH-37) Added logrotate management capability (credit: [@herd-the-cats](https://github.com/herd-the-cats))

### Changed

- Fixed linter warnings and code style
- (GH-33) Fixed a bug that caused the task that set the root password to fail. (credit: [Nate Henderson](https://github.com/nhenderson))
- (GH-35) Select predictable UID/GID for system user (credit: [@herd-the-cats](https://github.com/herd-the-cats))
- Configure swappiness only if the required command `sysctl` exists. If the command does not exist (e.g. in minimal Docker containers), the task would fail.

### Removed

## 3.0.0 - 2019-08-18

### Added

- (GH-19) Allow the user to set arbitrary configuration settings by providing a dictionary of keys/values in new role variable `mariadb_server_cnf`

### Changed

- (GH-20) Fix iteration for Python 3. (credit: [Dachi Natsvlishvili](https://github.com/dachinat))
- (GH-21) Fix for mysql module in newer Ansible versions. By providing the `socket` location, it is possible to bypass the requirement to have `.my.cnf` files on the server with credentials. (credit: [Dachi Natsvlishvili](https://github.com/dachinat))
- (GH-22) Database init scripts are now considered to be Jinja2 templates, so Ansible variables can be used in the scripts.
- (GH-24) Solve deprecation warning in swappiness (credit: [Adail Horst](https://github.com/SpawW))
- Update versions of supported distros, RedHat/CentOS 7.6 and Fedora 30
- Fix package names for Fedora and RedHat/CentOS.
- **Breaking change** Set default MariaDB version to latest stable release, 10.4.
- Issue a warning when the role variable `mariadb_root_password` was not set.

### Removed

### Changed

- (GH-7, GH-8) Fix for downloading from the MariaDB repository on RHEL systems (credit: [@raznikk](https://github.com/raznikk), [@piuma](https://github.com/piuma))

## 2.0.0 - 2017-07-13

### Added

- Swappiness can be configured, and is turned off by default. This means that swapping processes to disk is avoided at all cost.
